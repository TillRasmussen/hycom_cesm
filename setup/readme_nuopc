Building HYCOM with a NUOPC compliant component cap
===================================================

1) Make sure to have access to the Intel compilers,
and MPI. Also ensure that the ESMFMKFILE environment
variable is correctly set. On systems like Zeus there
may be modules available that help with this setup.

E.g. on Zeus you can do this:

module load intel mpt esmf/6.3.0r

2) Change into the "sorc" subdirectory.

3) Build HYCOM and the NUOPC compliant component cap
by using this command:

gmake ARCH=AintelIFC TYPE=nuopc nuopc

4) To clean the source distribution and start over use
the following command:

gmake ARCH=AintelIFC TYPE=nuopc clean

*gjt*
